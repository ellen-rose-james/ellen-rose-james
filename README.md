I am a software enthusiast who is currently on a really exciting learning journey of software development and UI/UX design. I love learning and trying new things, and I'm always happy to share my knowledge with others. When I'm not busy, I like to curl up with a good book or webtoon, listen to music, and try a new hobby or two.
